# Code-Quiz

Coding Quiz:
This quiz is designed to test the web development knowledge of a user. It quiz was built with HTML, css, and javascript, with an emphasis on javascript for the functionality. I used HTML for the structuring, CSS for the colors and fonts, and Javascript for the overall functioning of the buttons/pages.
